# Proteomics Data Analysis Platform

A comprehensive web application for advanced proteomics data analysis, built with Streamlit. This platform provides an end-to-end workflow for processing, analyzing, and visualizing proteomics datasets with interactive statistical tools and publication-quality visualizations.

## Features

### Data Processing & Analysis
- **Automatic Data Loading**: Loads comprehensive example proteomics data automatically for immediate analysis
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Normalization (Log2), filtering, imputation methods, and quality control tools
- **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests (paired/unpaired), ANOVA, correlation analysis, PLS-DA, and multiple comparison corrections
- **Power Analysis**: Statistical power calculations for study design validation

### Interactive Visualizations
- **Volcano Plots**: With customizable thresholds and statistical annotations
- **PCA Analysis**: Principal component analysis with confidence ellipses and clustering
- **PLS-DA Analysis**: Supervised analysis with VIP (Variable Importance in Projection) scoring
- **Heatmaps**: Both detailed sample-level and group average visualizations
- **Custom Protein Heatmaps**: User-specified protein subset analysis
- **UpSet Plots**: Visualize overlapping differentially expressed proteins across comparisons
- **Correlation Plots**: Within-group and between-group correlation analysis
- **Protein Expression Bar Plots**: Individual protein expression with statistical comparisons
- **Protein Rank Plots**: Dynamic range visualization of the proteome
- **Intensity Histograms**: Distribution analysis by sample groups

### Advanced Features
- **Multiple Testing Corrections**: Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR), Bonferroni, and permutation tests
- **Filtering Options**: By peptide count, coefficient of variation, and valid values percentage
- **Imputation Methods**: Mean, median, minimum, KNN, group-wise mean, and truncated normal
- **Export Capabilities**: Download visualizations as interactive HTML, publication-quality SVG, or CSV data files
- **Color-blind Friendly**: Accessible color palettes throughout the application
- **Comprehensive Download Options**: Protein sets, statistical results, and visualization files

## Quick Start

### Online Demo
Access the live application on Replit: [Your Replit URL]

### Local Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proteomics-analysis-platform.git
cd proteomics-analysis-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

The app will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:8501`

## Usage Workflow

1. **Data Configuration** (Page 1): The app automatically loads example proteomics data with 500 proteins and multiple sample groups
2. **Data Processing** (Page 2): Apply normalization, filtering, and quality control steps with real-time previews
3. **Visualization** (Page 3): Generate interactive plots, perform statistical analyses, and download results

### Sample Groups
The example dataset includes multiple cell line groups perfect for demonstrating comparative proteomics workflows:
- Control samples
- Treatment conditions
- Time-course data
- Biological replicates
